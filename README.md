# Challenge6 - Weather Dashboard
[live site](https://tgallagher496.github.io/Challenge6-WeatherForcast/)

## Description

This challenge uses weather API's to present the user with the current weather and a 5-day forcast of the city the user searches for.  The cities searched are stored in local storage and the last four searches are stored in a button on the screen for the user to easily access this information again.  


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/ReadMePic` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    
![ReadMe Image](/assets/ReadMePic.png)


## Resources

I used the information presented in the class.
